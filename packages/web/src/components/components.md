# About Components
Reactâ€™s Component can be thought of as a piece of the web page. It should be reusable across different pages.

But how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
