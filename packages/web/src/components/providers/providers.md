# About Providers
Reactâ€™s provider pattern is a powerful concept. React uses provider pattern to share data across the tree descendant
 nodes, called the React Context API.

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Providers can be thought of as global state managers.
